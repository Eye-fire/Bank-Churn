# Exploratory Data analysis on database
# Introduction
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a process for investigating datasets, elucidating subjects, and visualizing the outcomes. EDA is an approach for data analysis that applies a diversity of techniques to maximize certain insights into a data set; reveal underlying structure; extract significant variables; detect outliers and anomalies; test underlying assumptions; develop models, and determine best parameters for future estimations. 
This assignment by Mr. Kega is built on providing practical knowledge about the main pillars of EDA including data cleaning, data preparation, data exploration, and data visualization.
The study will provide the opportunity to explore open-source datasets including bank churn and salaries datasets, and many others. Using these real-life datasets, to understand the data, summarize their characteristics, and visualize them for business intelligence. 
We will be using Pandas, a powerful library for working with data, and other core Python libraries including NumPy and SciPy, StatsModels for regression, and Matplotlib for visualization.
